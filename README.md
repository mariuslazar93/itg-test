# Notes

* This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)
* I have used ReactJS, ES6 syntax, Fetch API and Flexbox.
* I did not used SASS or other CSS compiler because of the design simplicity.

# How to run

* NodeJS and NPM are required before testing this solution.
* Inside root folder, open a CLI and run 'npm install'
* After the install was finished, run 'npm run' and a local server will be opened.
